# Fruit Detection Model
This project is based on making a Neural Network to detect a fruit live.  
main2.py is the code for making the model fruitstest.model.  
Take atleast 500 pictures dataset of Apple, Banana and Orange each to make a good model.  
Use fruitsdetection.py to predict the fruit which you have in front of your camera.
